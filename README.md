# marketing-campaign

Task:

The goal in this problem is to design a model for predicting whether a customer will respond to the marketing campaign based on his/her information. In other words, predict the 'responded' target variable based on all the input variables provided.

Files:

marketing_training.csv - contains the training set that you will use to build the model. The target variable is ‘responded’
marketing_test.csv – contains testing data where the input variables are provided but not the ‘responded’ target column.

Provide the following:

• The source code you used to build the model and make predictions. (You are free to use any language and any open-source package/library)

• A .csv file containing the predictions of the test data. You can add the target column (‘responded’) to the test data or simply provide it alone with the ‘id’ column.

• Briefly answer the following questions:

- Describe your model and why did you choose this model over other types of models?

- Describe any other models you have tried and why do you think this model preforms better?

- How did you handle missing data?

- How did you handle categorical (string) data?

- How did you handle unbalanced data?

- How did you test your model?
